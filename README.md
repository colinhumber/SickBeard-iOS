SickBeard-iOS
=============

Clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:colinhumber/SickBeard-iOS.git`.   
Setup the submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`

You will need to be a registered Apple developer to install this on your device.

IMPORTANT: This project is designed to work on iOS 6 and lower. It has not been designed against iOS 7. If you compile this with Xcode 5 and link against iOS 7 it will not look good. It will still be functional...just not look as nice.

I am currently working on a design refresh for iOS 7 in the ios7-refresh branch. This will be a work in progress until it's merged into master, but feel free to check it out.
