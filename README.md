SickBeard-iOS
=============

Clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:colinhumber/SickBeard-iOS.git`.   
Setup the submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`

You will need to be a registered Apple developer to install this on your device.

IMPORTANT: The ```master``` branch is designed for iOS 6 and earlier. I'm working on an iOS 7 design in the ```ios7-refresh``` branch.
